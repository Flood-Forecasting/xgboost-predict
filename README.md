# Flood Forecasting with XGBoost
This repo contains the basic structural code which is required to run a flood prediction test using XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). If you are a coding beginner, head over to the Colab section for a beginner friendly colab notebook which you can run.

## Setup
To start, you must have the following:

1. Python installed on the system
2. Basic knowledge of programming, though writing code is not neccesary
3. Python Packages - Make sure you have pre-installed these packages by running the following in the terminal:
   ```
   pip install scikit-learn xgboost numpy pandas
   ```

## Prediction
4. Ensure that in the input folder of your working directory/folder, you have the following files: sample_submission.csv - this contains the format in which the software will return, train.csv - your training data and test.csv - your test data. Exemplar files can be found in the input folder in this repo.
5. If you haven't already, download prediction.ipynb
6. In a code editor (eg. VS Code or similar) run the python notebook. We highly recommend you download VS Code to run this, due to it's built in Jupyter Notebook rendering.
